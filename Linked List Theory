1. Linked list is a linear data structure.
2. In Linked list, memory is allocated during run-time where as in the case of arrays, memory is allocated during
    compile time.
3. Inserting a new element in linked list is easier as compared to arrays as we have to create space for insertion.
4. The size of array is fixed whereas, the size of linked list is flexible.
5. Elements of array are stored at a contiguous location,whereas the elements of linked list are linked uing pointers.
6. In Linked list each element is assigned a memory address randomly.The memory block of one element generally contains
    the data and memory location of next pointer.
